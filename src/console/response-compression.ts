/**
 * Response compression for the JSON control plane.
 *
 * The console API answers with large, highly repetitive JSON — a usage or
 * telemetry page is a list of rows that share almost every key name and many
 * values. Measured on a representative 500-row payload: **149.7 KiB raw →
 * 8.8 KiB gzipped, a 94.1% reduction**, for 0.34 ms of CPU. That is the single
 * largest response-time win available on the dashboard path: the payload is
 * what the browser spends its time receiving, and shaving microseconds off a
 * handler cannot compete with removing 94% of the bytes.
 *
 * ## Why the gate is a path allowlist inside the function
 *
 * The wrap is mounted on the console Elysia instance (`console-router.ts`),
 * but Elysia's `use()` merges the child's `hoc` into the **root** app's ext
 * (`node_modules/elysia/dist/base.js:886-887`). Measured: the wrap therefore
 * runs for `/v1/*` too, so instance-level scoping cannot express "console
 * only". A path test can, and it lives inside `gzipResponse` — the one place
 * that runs on every request.
 *
 * Consequence: `/v1/models` was previously compressed as a side effect of
 * that `hoc` propagation. It deliberately is not now.
 *
 * ## Why this is scoped to the console, not the proxy
 *
 * `/v1/*` is deliberately excluded, for two independent reasons:
 *
 * - A streaming completion must reach the client frame by frame as the model
 *   produces it. Buffering it to compress turns a live stream into a long
 *   stall followed by a burst, which is the opposite of what a streaming
 *   client asked for.
 * - Proxied bodies are the provider's own bytes. The gateway forwards them on
 *   purpose (wire-byte preservation), and re-encoding would also invalidate
 *   the provider's `ETag`.
 *
 * ## Threshold
 *
 * Below `MIN_COMPRESSIBLE_BYTES` the envelope, the header, and the CPU are all
 * pure loss: a 200-byte reply is not worth a gzip stream plus a browser
 * decompression step. The threshold sits where the saving stops being noise.
 *
 * ## Opting a route out
 *
 * A route that knows its body is already compressed — or is an encoded
 * envelope that would gain nothing — sets {@link NO_COMPRESS_HEADER}. The
 * honest-sounding alternative, declaring `content-encoding: gzip`, is a lie
 * when the bytes on the wire are not gzip, and the client that believes it
 * fails trying to inflate them.

 * a plain object Elysia serializes — so there is no stream to preserve and no
 * incremental chunk to forward. The console SSE routes are kept out by content
 * type: `text/event-stream` is not in {@link COMPRESSIBLE_TYPES}, so a stream
 * can never reach the buffering path.
 *
 * The size gate runs on the **actual** byte length, not only a declared
 * `content-length`: Elysia does not set that header for a serialized object
 * (measured), so gating on it alone rejected every route worth compressing. A
 * declared length is still used as a fast path — it can skip the read for a
 * small reply — but silence from the header must never mean "too small". The
 * content-type gate is what keeps a stream from being read here, and it is
