/**
 * The free tier shared by the OpenRouter-backed providers.
 *
 * Cline, Kilo Code and OpenRouter serve one model catalog, and every id below
 * was verified to exist under `openrouter`, `kilo` and `cline` — so this
 * roster is a catalog fact, not a per-provider guess, and it lives in one
 * place rather than being restated three times. Dropping a row here unlists
 * it from all three providers' seeded catalog at the next boot; live
 * discovery will still find it, which is the intended prune.
 *
 * The limits, modalities and capability flags are read from OpenRouter's own
 * `/api/v1/models`, which states `context_length`,
 * `top_provider.max_completion_tokens`, `architecture.input_modalities` and
 * `supported_parameters`. That is the serving catalog's declaration, so these
 * are measurements rather than defaults.
 *
 * The set is curated: a 2.6B toy (`liquid/lfm-2.5-2.6b:free`) and the
 * upstream content-safety classifier (`nvidia/nemotron-3.5-content-safety:free`)
 * are deliberately not seeded — a prefill classifier is not a chat model.
 *
 * This is a floor, not the authority: each provider also discovers live, and a
 * row the listing carries that this roster does not is still found there. The
 * roster exists so a fresh install has a usable free tier before any fetch, and
 * so the free section is populated even when discovery is unavailable.
