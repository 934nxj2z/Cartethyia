/**
 * Cline's quota headers must state two different versions in two different
 * slots.
 *
 * `x-core-version` is the `@cline/sdk` version — a separate npm package with
 * its own release line. This used to send the *client* version there too, so
 * the billing surface was told our core was `4.1.23`, a VS Code extension
 * version `@cline/sdk` has never published. `src/providers/integrations/cline/
 * cline.ts` has always sent the correct pairing on the chat surface.
 *
 * Why this is not cosmetic: Cline's refusal for an implausible client identity
 * is `Unauthorized: Please make sure you're using the latest version of Cline
 * and re-authenticate your Cline account.` — the same wording it returns for a
 * dead credential. A header the upstream validates is therefore indistinguishable
 * from an auth failure at the response, which is exactly how this presented
 * before: as "the quota endpoint rejected us", pointing an operator at
 * re-authenticating an account whose chat requests were working.
 *
 * The headers are private, so this observes them where they are actually used:
 * the request `fetchClineQuota` issues. A local fetcher captures the headers and
 * returns a minimal valid shape.
