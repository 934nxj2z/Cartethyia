/**
 * Which account a re-login replaces.
 *
 * The failure this pins: a provider that resolves no account label falls back to
 * the refresh token for its identity. When the flow also mirrors the access
 * token into the refresh field (Cursor's device/API-key grant does exactly
 * that), two *different* logins can hash the same way or, worse, an unchanged
 * value makes a genuinely new account land on the old row — the operator adds a
 * second account and watches the first one disappear.
 *
 * The identity has to be something the upstream says is *the account*, not
 * something that merely happens to be present.
