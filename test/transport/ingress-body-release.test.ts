/**
 * The ingress body is released as soon as it can no longer be needed.
 *
 * The parsed body is the largest thing a request holds, and before this the
 * gateway kept it on the request state until the response finished — which, for
 * a streaming request, is the entire upstream stream. This asserts the two
 * halves of the contract through the real middleware chain (ingress policy →
 * canonical-request guard), not by calling the release method directly:
 *
 * 1. In a `none`/`metadata` capture mode the body is released once the canonical
 *    request exists.
 * 2. In `full` mode the body is retained, because payload capture reads it at
 *    finalize.
 * 3. A request rejected before the canonical guard still carries its body, so
 *    early-rejection capture is unaffected.
